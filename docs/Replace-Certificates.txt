Import a Self-signed or CA-signed Certificate

After you install NSX-T Data Center, the manager nodes and cluster have self-signed certificates. Replace the self-signed certificates with a CA-signed certificate and use a single common CA-signed certificate with a SAN (Subject Alternative Name) that matches all the nodes and the VIP for the cluster. You can run only one certificate replacement operation at a time.

If you are using NSX Federation, you can replace the GM API certificates, GM cluster certificate, LM API certificates, and LM cluster certificates using the following APIs.

When you replace the GM or LM certificate, the site-manager sends these to all the other federated sites, so communication remains intact.
The cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 can now be used or replaced for communication between:

    the NSX-T Data Center nodes with in the cluster.
    within the NSX Federation.
    NSX Manager to NSX Edge.
    NSX Manager to NSX-T Data Center agent.
    the NSX Manager REST API communication (external).

You can also replace the platform Principal Identity certificates auto-created for the Global Manager and Local Manager appliances. See Certificates for NSX Federation for details on self-signed certificates auto-configured for NSX Federation.
Note: For Cloud Service Manager, it is not possible to replace the HTTP certificate in an NSX-T Data Center environment.
Prerequisites

    Verify that a certificate is available in the NSX Manager. Note that on a standby Global Manager the UI import operation is deactivated. For details on the import REST API command for a standby Global Manager, refer to Import a Self-signed or CA-signed Certificate.
    The server certificate must contain the Basic Constraints extension basicConstraints = cA:FALSE.
    Verify that the certificate is valid by making the following API call:

    GET https://<nsx-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/<cert-id>?action=validate
    Note: Do not use automated scripts to replace multiple certificates at the same time. Errors might occur.

Procedure

    With admin privileges, log in to NSX Manager.
    Select System > Certificates.
    In the ID column, select the ID of the certificate you want to use and copy the certificate ID from the pop-up window.
    Make sure that when this certificate was imported, the option Service Certificate was set to No.

    Note: The certificate chain must be in the industry standard order of 'certificate - intermediate - root.'
    To replace the certificate of a manager node, use the API call:

POST /api/v1/trust-management/certificates/<cert-id>?action=apply_certificate&service_type=API&node_id=<node-id>

For example:
POST https://<nsx-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/77c5dc5c-6ba5-4e74-a801-c27dc09be76b?action=apply_certificate&service_type=API&node_id=e61c7537-3090-4149-b2b6-19915c20504f

For more information about the API, see the NSX-T Data Center API Guide.
To replace the certificate of the manager cluster VIP, use the API call:

POST /api/v1/trust-management/certificates/<cert-id>?action=apply_certificate&service_type=MGMT_CLUSTER

For example:
POST https://<nsx-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/d60c6a07-6e59-4873-8edb-339bf75711?action=apply_certificate&service_type=MGMT_CLUSTER

Note: The certificate chain must be in the industry standard order of certificate - intermediate - root.

For more information about the API, see the NSX-T Data Center API Guide. This step is not necessary if you did not configure VIP.
(Optional) To replace the Local Manager and Global Manager Principal Identity certificates for NSX Federation use the following API call. The entire NSX Manager cluster (Local Manager and Global Manager) requires a single PI certificate.
Note: Do not use this procedure to replace a Principal Identity certificate not related to NSX Federation. To replace a Principal Identity certificate, refer to Add a Role Assignment or Principal Identity for instructions.

POST https://<nsx-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/<cert-id>?action=apply_certificate&service_type=<service-type>

For example:

POST https://<local-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/77c5dc5c-6ba5-4e74-a801-c27dc09be76b?action=apply_certificate&service_type=LOCAL_MANAGER

Or

POST https://<global-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/77c5dc5c-6ba5-4e74-a801-c27dc09be76b?action=apply_certificate&service_type=GLOBAL_MANAGER

To replace APH-APR certificates use the API call:

POST https://<nsx-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/<cert-id>?action=apply_certificate&service_type=APH

For example:

POST https://<nsx-mgr>/api/v1/trust-management/certificates/77c5dc5c-6ba5-4e74-a801-c27dc09be79b?action=apply_certificate&service_type=APH
